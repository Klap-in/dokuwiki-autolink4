====== Auto Link 4 ======
//by Eli Fenton//

Lines consist of four fields separated by commas:
  * Text to find. This can include certain regular expression characters, like square brackets and question marks. Pipe (|) and parentheses are not allowed.
  * The link for the text.
  * The namespace where the replacement is done. Omit this field to replace everywhere.
  * Flags. Supported values:
    * tt: Hovering over this link will show a tooltip with the page title and abstract. Requires the [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:autotooltip|autotooltip]] plugin.

For example, this will link the words "Thing," "thing," "Things" and "things" to mywiki:thing, but only inside the mywiki namespace:

  [Tt]hings?, mywiki:thing, mywiki
